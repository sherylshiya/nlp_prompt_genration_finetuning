<h1>Hey there🙋🏻‍♀️</h1>
This project aims to develop a robust NLP model capable of generating effective prompts that instruct a large language model (LLM) to perform specific tasks accurately and efficiently.
This project bridge the gap between human intent and machine execution by automating the creation of precise and contextually relevant prompts.
Identify a diverse range of tasks suitable for LLM execution (e.g., summarization, question answering, text generation, translation).
Break down complex tasks into sub-tasks to facilitate prompt engineering.

<B>Potential Benefits:</B>
<h4><ul>
